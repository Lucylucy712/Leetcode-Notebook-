![An example of an "is a" hierarchy involving architectural buildings](2021-03-16-09-13-32.png)

In object-oriented programming, the mechanism for a modular and hierarchical organization is a technique known as inheritance. The existing class is the ***base/parent class*** , while the newly defined one is the ***subclass/child class***. 

1. A subclass may sepcialize an existing behavior by providing a new implementation that overrides an existing method 
2. It may also extend its superclass by providing brand new methods. 


## Check the ***2.4 Example CreditCard Class.py*** for an simple example 

1. The `__init__` constructor replies upon making a call to the inherited constructor for most of the initialization. `super().__init__(customer,bank,acnt,limit)`

2. If the new method replies on a call to the inherited  method, we need `super().charge(price)`.


## Abstract Base Classes

We say a class is an abstract base class if its only purpose is to serve as a base class through inheritance. 

Python's built-in data structures rely on an object-oriented software design pattern known as the *template method pattern*. It is when an abstract base class provides concrete behaviors that rely upon class on other abstract behaviors. 

For example, the collections.Sequence abstract base class defines behaviors common to Python's list,str,and tuple classes, as sequences that support element access via an integer index.

*ABCMeta* class is a metaclass, in that it provides a template for the class definition itself.
