***Pesudo-Code***
It's a descriptions readable for human before we start writing an algorithms. 


**Coding Style and Documentation***
[Official Style Guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#naming-conventions)

- Classes: 
      - Capitalized singular noun (e.g., `Date` rather than `Dates`) 
      - Each word shoule be Capitalized (e.g., `CreditCalss`) 
- Functions:
      - lowercase 
      - multiple words are combined by underscores (e.g., `make_payment`)
      - If the function's purpose is to return a value, it should be a noun to describe the value (e.g., `sqrt` rather than `calculate_sqrt`

- Names:
      - lowercase noun for an individual object 
      - A constant should be represented using all captial letters with underscores toseparapte words (e.g., `MAX_SIZE`)
