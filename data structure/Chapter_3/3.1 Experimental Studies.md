A *data sturcture* is a systematic way of organizing and accessing data, and an *algorithm* is a step-by-step procedure for performing some task in a finite amount of time. 

*Running time* is a natural measture of "goodness" since tims is a precious resource (we always want a computer soluution run as fast as possible.). Regradless of difference from hardware and software environments, we are interested in the relationship between the running time and the size of its input.
