# Arrays 

## Introductions:   [Duke Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures/lecture/OsBSF/arrays)

1. **Defination**

Array is contiguous area of memory consisting of equal-size elements indexed by contiguous integers

2. **Times for Commom Operations** 

|  | Add  | Remove |
| ----------- | :-----------: | -------:|
| Beginning | O(n) |O(n)|
| End | O(1) | O(1)|
| Middle|O(n)|O(n)|

It's great if we want to add at End. But it's expensive if we want to add it at beinning or Middle.


3 **Advantage**

It has a constant-time access to any element (read or write)
