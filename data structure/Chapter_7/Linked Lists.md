## singly linked list

A collection of nodes that collectively form a linear sequence. Each node stores a reference to an object that is an element of the sequence, as well as a reference to the next node of the list.

*head* refers to the first node, while *tail* is the last node of a linked list. We can identify the tail as the node having `None` as its next reference. 

A linked list doesn't have a predetermined fixed size like array or queue. It uses space proportionally to its current number of elements.
